# SyncPipes RESTful Server

## Requirements

* MongoDB
* RabbitMQ
* __node.js (v6.0 and above)__ and npm
* [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) `npm install --global typings`
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) `npm install --global gulp-cli`

## Install

1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `typings install` 
1. Run `gulp serve`

## Configuration
1. Rename `.env.sample` to `.env`
1. Change `SYNCPIPES_MONGO_DATABASE` in `.env` to your database name

## Docker support

The application has build in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) support. It also supports [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) to manage all dependencies.

You can start the complete application stack using `docker-compose up`

## Using the API

To use access the API either a generic REST-Client like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or the official SyncPipes client application can be used.

We suggest to use the official Angular.js [client application](https://github.com/sebischair/syncpipes-client).

The complete API documentation can be found in `docs/API.md`


## Setting up SSL for RabbitMQ
Refer to https://www.rabbitmq.com/ssl.html to create certificates
Copy and paste client certificates to cert folder 


## MongoDB settings with auth

# Create a guest user for syncpipes collection
> use syncpipes

> db.createUser( { user: "guest", pwd: "guest", roles: [ { role: "clusterAdmin", db: "admin" }, { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }, {role: "readWrite", db: "admin"}, "readWrite" ] } );

# Mongo Config file for mongo service
```json
systemLog:
    destination: file
    path: c:\data\log\mongod.log
storage:
    dbPath: c:\data\db
security:
    authorization: enabled
```

Update .env configuration file for custom settings
